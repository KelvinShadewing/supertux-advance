		"hiff-0" :

		"pipes" :
		"KELVIN: I was going to have the pipes behave the same as the ones in Mario, but I found it annoying in those games having to tap up/down to find which ones were open, so instead, you just fall in.",
		"firetux" :
		"KELVIN: Originally, Fire Tux was going to have a helmet, as in the original SuperTux. A member of the SuperTux Discord server suggested using the design by Rusty Box. I agreed it looked better. The original can still be found on OpenGameArt.org.",
		"coins" :
		"KELVIN: Coins were originally just for achievements, but this made players who didn't care for that not bother picking them up. We went with lives for a while, but lives are an archaic concept of game design that were scrapped shortly after. Finally, we decided on adding upgrades to shops, on top of the free powerups.",
		"sliding" :
		"KELVIN: The mechanic of increasing speed from dropping off a ledge came from needing to compensate for slopes not accelerating the player enough. It's tech- nically a glitch that I decided to throw in because it was fun. Many mechanics are actually that.",
		"trees" :
		"KELVIN: Trees don't grow in Antarctica. That's why penguins carve them out of ice.",
		"snakes" :
		"KELVIN: I know it makes about as much sense to have snakes in Antarctica as it does to have hungry plants. ",
		"waterfalls" :
		"KELVIN: This part of the cave looks especially nice to me. I love the spacious background with waterfalls in front of it. I wanted the level to feel like you were meant to explore it, so a scene like this that makes it feel big is meant to convey a sense of exploration.",

		"FROSTC: I didn't actually know you could just wall jump to get up here when I first made this area. I later thought of adding something to keep you from doing that, but decided against it",
		"tnt" :
		"FROSTC: I saw that TNT was used in Xtreme hills, so I decided to make a level showing it off. Also, fun fact, V1 of this map was finished before subsea. You can find V1 in the extras world.",
		"trans" :
		"FROSTC: It took me a good while to get the background transition to work, as this was for the most part the first time I used triggers.",

		"FROSTC: For those who played the older versions, I hope you like the all new, much harder 1-up position! Hahahahahaha!!",
		"signnote" :
		"FROSTC: If you are feeling a little lazy, you can just blast the pipe with a fireball to open it instead of sliding. Maybe a good speedrunning strat??",
		"sense":
		"FROSTC: My 3rd level, just wanted to make a level losely inspired off of Grumbel's Sense of Snow from the classic SuperTux. The funny part is, that level isn't even in modern versions of OG SuperTux!",
		"subsea" :
		"KELVIN: I wasn't sure how I wanted to handle underwater levels at first. I thought of the levels from SMB 1 and 3, but they seemed like something Tux could just shoot right through. Then I remembered DKC's underwater levels, how they were more like mazes where you had to dodge dangerous enemies. I figured that would work well for this game, since Tux is fast under water, and Konqi and Midi retain offensive capabilities in their neutral forms.",
		"subsea-name" :
		"KELVIN: The name, Subsea, comes from the track of the same name in SuperTuxKart. I was thinking it'd be cool to take areas from that game and reimagine them as platform levels instead of kart tracks. Candela City is planned as well, and the final level where you fight Nolok will be Fort Magma. Others from STK may appear as well.",
		"tutorial-zone" :
		"KELVIN: After getting some playtest feedback from Aurora Sol, I decided I should make this tutorial area to more clearly demonstrate basic mechanics. In his playtest, he actually skipped the first pipe, despite it having a sign hinting there's something about it, which led to him skipping the spot to learn swimming, too. Sliding places weren't clearly marked, either, and were also missed. This area won't let you progress until you've learned each mechanic, but can still be skipped if you already know the basics.",
		"speedrunex":
		"FROSTC: I had designed this level with the intention of people speedrunning it, so see how fast you can beat it! ",
		"secretredex":
		"FROSTC: The current version of this secret is very diffrent compared to how it used to be. One diffrence is that it used to have a bend in it. however I couldn't get that to work properly, that being the reason I scrapped it.",
		"fishex":
		"FROSTC: Just like Tux 'N' Trouble, this level was made before some of the earlier levels were added.",
		"mezex":
		"FROSTC: I had to make a few custom tiles to make this maze look good. It was worth it, I think! It's for sure the best part of this level.",

		"oldxtreme":
		"KELVIN: In previous versions of this level, the prize for getting all the coins was a powerup that isn't formally introduced until a few levels later. I thought it would be fun to earn the chance to break levels, but the design of them actually makes the powerup not as fun to use as I'd hoped. I instead decided to set up a collectible that could unlock new content later on.",
		"fort-0":
		"KELVIN: I wanted to teach players right away that if they wanted rewards, they had to take risks, so I put these coins over a fire chain. There's an even trickier secret in this room that's also risky.",
		"fort-1":
		"KELVIN: The sawblades here were originally the first challenge, but then I realized I was making players not only take one of the harder challenges first, but also leading them in a straight line down. Switching the order of the challenges made the learning curve a bit easier, and also make the map feel more metroidvania-like.",
		"fort-2":
		"KELVIN: I knew some players would come here with the earth shell, which makes the challenge for the gold key much harder, if not impossible. I added a room with a fire flower to make swimming easier without depowering the player. Placing it behind a silver lock, the same lock leading to the next challenge, means they'll have a chance to reach it when they need it.",
		"fort-3":
		"KELVIN: I really wanted a section where players would get chased by something indestructible. Messing around with fire chains, I found I could put four in one place to make them look like a wheel. Attaching them to my new path carriers makes them able to roll around just above the player's top speed makes this scene tense but manageable.",
		"fort-4":
		"KELVIN: I plan to revisit underwater sections in the future with spike mazes like this, but after using a giant fire chain in a secret treasure room, I thought it was too good not to use in one of the key challenges.",
		"fort-5":
		"KELVIN: Welcome to the freezer, the final platforming challenge for Fort Borealis. Given that this is the last level of the ice world, I wanted to give it a good, cold sendoff. Don't worry, ice tiles will be used again, but I wanted to test the player a bit harder with these.",
		"fort-6":
		"KELVIN: Checkpoints used to be just that, checkpoints. They didn't do anything but save your progress in a level. But with a level like this being so long, and health drops being a rare thing given that the game had been designed with short levels in mind up until now, I needed to give players a way to heal after long stretches. Since checkpoints are already a welcome sight to players, I decided to make them even more welcoming.",
		"fort-7":
		"KELVIN: This is it, the first boss of the game. Up until now, it's all been single-hit enemies and stage hazards. He hasn't been implemented yet, but I can't wait to see what I come up with for him.",
		"fort-8":
		"KELVIN: OK, I'll admit, I was just going crazy with this. I wanted to see if multiple ring carriers could be nested, and then I stuck the result onto a path carrier. The result is a storm of coins! One layer of slime later, and here we are. Have fun!",
		"sunken":
		"FROSTC: My original idea for this level was to have a gimmick where there's patches of deep snow that tux can talk or maybe even through. sorta like the powered snow from... the game minetest is based off of? Can I say that name here?..",
		"continue":
		"FROSTC: This was where kelvins part ends, and where mine starts. do keep in mind I also touched up some part of kelvin's section. (you can find the old version in the extras world) ",
		"secret-sunk":
		"FROSTC: If I were you, I would keep an eye out for little dent in the land like this. they often lead to secrets."
