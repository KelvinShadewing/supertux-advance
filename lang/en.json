		"pipes" :

		"firetux" :
		"KELVIN: Originally, Fire Tux was going to have a helmet, as in the original SuperTux. A member of the SuperTux Discord server suggested using the design by Rusty Box. I agreed it looked better. The original can still be found on OpenGameArt.org.",
		"coins" :
		"KELVIN: Coins were originally just for achievements, but this made players who didn't care for that not bother picking them up. We went with lives for a while, but lives are an archaic concept of game design that were scrapped shortly after. Finally, we decided on adding upgrades to shops, on top of the free powerups.",
		"sliding" :
		"KELVIN: The mechanic of increasing speed from dropping off a ledge came from needing to compensate for slopes not accelerating the player enough. It's technically a glitch that I decided to throw in because it was fun. Many mechanics are actually that.",
		"trees" :
		"KELVIN: Trees don't grow in Antarctica. That's why penguins carve them out of ice.",

		"waterfalls" :

		"sense":
		"FROSTC: My 3rd level, just wanted to make a level losely inspired off of Grumbel's Sense of Snow from the classic SuperTux. Being that Grumbel's sense of snow was removed from supertux, you could say the level lives on through this level.",
		"subsea" :
		"KELVIN: I wasn't sure how I wanted to handle underwater levels at first. I thought of the levels from SMB 1 and 3, but they seemed like something Tux could just shoot right through. Then I remembered DKC's underwater levels, how they were more like mazes where you had to dodge dangerous enemies. I figured that would work well for this game, since Tux is fast under water, and Konqi and Midi retain offensive capabilities in their neutral forms.",
		"subsea-name" :
		"KELVIN: The name, Subsea, comes from the track of the same name in SuperTuxKart. I was thinking it'd be cool to take areas from that game and reimagine them as platform levels instead of kart tracks. Candela City is planned as well, and the final level where you fight Nolok will be Fort Magma. Others from STK may appear as well.",
		"tutorial-zone" :
		"KELVIN: After getting some playtest feedback from Aurora Sol, I decided I should make this tutorial area to more clearly demonstrate basic mechanics. In his playtest, he actually skipped the first pipe, despite it having a sign hinting there's something about it, which led to him skipping the spot to learn swimming, too. Sliding places weren't clearly marked, either, and were also missed. This area won't let you progress until you've learned each mechanic, but can still be skipped if you already know the basics.",

		"KELVIN: In previous versions of this level, the prize for getting all the coins was a powerup that isn't formally introduced until a few levels later. I thought it would be fun to earn the chance to break levels, but the design of them actually makes the powerup not as fun to use as I'd hoped. I instead decided to set up a collectible that could unlock new content later on.",
		"fort-0":
		"KELVIN: I wanted to teach players right away that if they wanted rewards, they had to take risks, so I put these coins over a fire chain. There's an even trickier secret in this room that's also risky.",
		"fort-1":
		"KELVIN: The sawblades here were originally the first challenge, but then I realized I was making players not only take one of the harder challenges first, but also leading them in a straight line down. Switching the order of the challenges made the learning curve a bit easier, and also make the map feel more metroidvania-like.",
		"fort-2":
		"KELVIN: I knew some players would come here with the earth shell, which makes the challenge for the gold key much harder, if not impossible. I added a room with a fire flower to make swimming easier without depowering the player. Placing it behind a silver lock, the same lock leading to the next challenge, means they'll have a chance to reach it when they need it.",
		"fort-3":
		"KELVIN: I really wanted a section where players would get chased by something indestructible. Messing around with fire chains, I found I could put four in one place to make them look like a wheel, later reducing it as a performance precaution. Attaching them to my new path carriers makes them able to roll around just above the player's top speed makes this scene tense but manageable.",
		"fort-4":
		"KELVIN: I plan to revisit underwater sections in the future with spike mazes like this, but after using a giant fire chain in a secret treasure room, I thought it was too good not to use in one of the key challenges.",
		"fort-5":
		"KELVIN: Welcome to the freezer, the final platforming challenge for Fort Borealis. Given that this is the last level of the ice world, I wanted to give it a good, cold sendoff. Don't worry, ice tiles will be used again, but I wanted to test the player a bit harder with these.",
		"fort-6":
		"KELVIN: Checkpoints used to be just that, checkpoints. They didn't do anything but save your progress in a level. But with a level like this being so long, and health drops being a rare thing given that the game had been designed with short levels in mind up until now, I needed to give players a way to heal after long stretches. Since checkpoints are already a welcome sight to players, I decided to make them even more welcoming.",
		"fort-7":
		"KELVIN: This is it, the first boss of the game. Up until now, it's all been single-hit enemies and stage hazards. I had originally intended this guy to be a wake-up call boss, but on top of the existing challenge, I made his defense way too high, so fights took a long time. After being reminded that this is more Mario/Sonic like and less Megaman/Metroid like, and that the boss needs to fit that formula, I reduced his health.",
		"fort-8":
		"KELVIN: I used to have something crazy in this room when messing with ring carrier objects (the things that can make arrays of coins and enemies travel in circles), and was testing to see if ring carriers could hold other ring carriers. It worked, and nesting it a few times gave me a massive storm of coins. I might bring it back in a future level. We'll see.",
		"sunken":
		"FROSTC: My original idea for this level was to have a gimmick where there's patches of deep snow that tux can walk or maybe even slide through, like the powered snow from Minecraft.",
		"continue":
		"FROSTC: This was another level that had to be remade because of it's quality, with the first one being the ocean bridge, which is the level after this. Honestly kinda sad the old one had to go, because it was one of the few levels Kelvin had a large part in making.",
		"Forest-lefttext":
		"FROSTC: If you played the old version of frostlands, you might be familiar with the name of this level. When making the updated version of frostlands, I had decided to that i would remake the level to the left, and replace it with a better one. which ended up being lost ruins. For some reason, Kelvin decided to put the old to the left into the forest world. Why? I don't know! The level sucked. To avoid the forest world having such an awful first level, I remade it from scratch. The remake is what you should be playing now.",
